# Bugbuster

A mobile responsive web application to help developers manage project work and bug reports. The application allows engineering teams to track all actions across multiple projects in one centralized location for teams to share and resolve tickets. This web-based application demonstrates my working knowledge of Postgres, Rails, RESTful API, React, Redux, UI, CSS, HTML, JWT, Bcrypt, Bulma to develop the frontend user experience.

# Motivation

Building this app was motivated by my desire to more deeply understand the process of planning that goes into a project, in addition to wanting to get a hang of Redux, APIs, and responsive CSS. Here's hoping this project helps my fellow engineering community better execute their own projects!
